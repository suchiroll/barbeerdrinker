I was unable to finish this unfortunately and I deeply apologize. I sent an email last week ago regarding my difficulties managing this project, due to my disability (the documentation is with the email) and also some extremely urgent and intensive assignments that were given to me with very short deadlines through my job interview process. Specifically this week, I had three separate assignments to do, including one this weekend that I only had 24 hours to finish. On top of that, beginning monday I had five interviews that were at least an hour long, and also coding exams that were also over an hour.

  I would really like any opportunity to try to fix this and make a functioning app and I am asking for any help I could possibly have. I am supposed to be graduating next month so it is essential I at least get a ‘D’ in this class. I’m really sorry for the inconvenience and my inability to manage it. I had a really hard time this past month juggling the interview process with school, along with my own health.
